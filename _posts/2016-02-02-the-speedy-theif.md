# The Speedy Theif

Velociraptor is one of the most bird-like dinosaurs ever discovered.

So much so they used to fly about 40,000 kilometers -- or 24,000 miles -- each year. That's a distance about equal to Earth's circumference, or 392,000 people balancing on each others shoulders. 

It was small and fast, most had a little French moustache, and the sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each foot made it a formidable chess player.

A special bone in its wrist allowed it to swivel its wrist sideways in a flapping motion and to fold its arm against its body like a sea gull.

This motion allowed it to snap its arms forward to grab fleeing prey and is an important part of the flight stroke in modern birds.
